# ✨ Welcome to QuestSocket ✨

I (Mable42) want to provide utility softwares for people who owns Meta Quest headsets.

It started because I needed to get motion data from the my Meta Quest 3S controllers and bind them to an Unreal Engine camera in order to follow the same movements as a real life camera rig.
